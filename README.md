# Team Hackoz - Syncs Hackathon 2025

# Inspiration
The inspiration for "BrightEcho" drew from the need for regular citizens to speak out about everyday problems in regards to infrastructure(???) and possibly have direct positive impact on living standards.


# What it does

"BrightEcho" is a iOS based mobile app that targets towards a responsive community. People from anywhere around the globe are able to create Issue threads Any time of the day  ,


Users can participate by submitting their attempts through videos or photos. Friends can then review and approve these submissions, adding a layer of social interaction and accountability. Additionally, the app provides a chat function where users can discuss strategies, share tips, and connect over their shared experiences. SkillUp brings people together by encouraging them to learn and grow together through common challenges.


# How we built it


"BrightEcho" was built using React native + JavaScript for the front-end, which allowed our team to create a neat user interface that is compatible on iOS .We implemented Supabase for the back-end, utilizing its real-time database capabilities to manage user metadata, challenge submissions, and interactions. This setup allowed for efficient data handling and real-time updates across the app.


For seamless interaction among teammates, we used GitHub as our version control system to manage our codebase, initially following the single collaboration model. As the project scaled up we made decision to come up with a united ideas push from a single branch.


# Challenges we ran into


We had faced problems with Supabase's connection, which caused issues with compatibility across different platforms.


Getting cross-platform builds to work also required a lot of debugging.


# Accomplishments that we're proud of


We are really proud of our overall structure and how we worked together through everything to create a software design that we are all passionate about.


# What we learned


Throughout the hackathon, we learnt about mobile(iOS) development using React native. We gained valuable experience working with git and ensuring our tech stack worked all together in a neat way. Most importantly we got experience creating a full on web app the very first for many of us.


What's next for BrightEcho


As part of next step towards a fine tuned software we are planning to add more detailed functionality to the polling page .
